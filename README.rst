**DASI** is a metadata-driven data store. It is a semantic interface for data, where the data is indexed and uniquely identified by sets of scientifically-meaningful metadata keys.
DASI is modular and is compatible with multiple backends (i.e., object stores or POSIX) through diverse frontends (Python, C++, C).

**Warning**
This project is BETA and will be experimental for the foreseeable future. Interfaces and functionality are likely to change. DO NOT use this software in any project/software that is operational.


Introduction
============

DASI is built on top of FDB [1]_, which has been developed
at ECMWF [2]_ for previous EU projects (see `Acknowledgements <https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/dasi/docs/acknowledgements.rst>`_) and
has been adapted to be highly configurable for different domains.
Using FDB allows DASI to use various backends, such as POSIX, Ceph and Cortx-Motr object-storage, and NVRAM backend.

Configuration
-------------

An example configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   schema: path/to/schema/file
   catalogue: toc
   store: file
   spaces:
      - handler: Default
      roots:
      - path: path/to/data/output1
      - path: path/to/data/output2


Schema
------

The schema defines the metadata keys which index and identify the data within a domain.

An example schema describing a hierarchical taxonomy of metadata keys:

.. code-block:: yaml

   [ User, Laboratory?, Project
      [ DateTime, Processing
         [ Type, Object ]]]

Installation
============

DASI Library (C/C++)
--------------------

The supported way to install DASI library is by building from source.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* C/C++ compiler
* `CMake`_
* `ecbuild`_
* `eckit`_
* `metkit`_
* `fdb`_

Build and Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/dasi
   cd dasi

   # Setup environment variables (edit as needed)
   SRC_DIR=$(pwd)
   BUILD_DIR=build
   INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/local
   export eckit_DIR=$ECKIT_DIR
   export metkit_DIR=$METKIT_DIR
   export fdb5_DIR=$FDB_DIR

   # Create the the build directory
   mkdir $BUILD_DIR
   cd $BUILD_DIR

   # Run ecbuild (CMake)
   ecbuild --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR -- $SRC_DIR

   # Build and install
   make -j10
   make test      # optional
   make install

   # Check installation
   $INSTALL_DIR/bin/dasi --version


Install pydasi
--------------

The Python interface to DASI is called **pydasi**.
It uses the `cffi`_ Python package for interfacing with the DASI C API.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `DASI Library (C/C++)`_
* `cffi`_


Optional: Python Environment Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is advised to create a virtual Python environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd project_dir
   $ python -m venv .venv
   $ source .venv/bin/activate


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**pydasi** can be installed using **pip** command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd project_dir
   $ source .venv/bin/activate
   (.venv) $ pip install cffi
   (.venv) $ pip install pydasi
