Data Access and Storage Interface (DASI)
========================================

**DASI** is a metadata-driven data store. It is a semantic interface for data, where the data is indexed
and uniquely identified by sets of scientifically-meaningful metadata keys.
DASI is modular and is compatible with multiple backends
(i.e., object stores or POSIX) through diverse :doc:`api` (Python, C++, C).
