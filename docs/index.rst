Data Access and Storage Interface (DASI)
========================================

**DASI** is a metadata-driven data store developed by `ECMWF <https://www.ecmwf.int>`_ as part of the EuroHPC project `IO-SEA <https://iosea-project.eu/>`_.
It is a semantic interface for data, where the data is indexed and uniquely identified by sets of scientifically-meaningful metadata keys.
DASI is modular and is compatible with multiple backends (i.e., object stores or POSIX) through diverse :doc:`api` (Python, C++, C).
